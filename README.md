# Finite Element Analysis with transient forces. 
--
An implementation of the finite element method for 3D meshes with transient loads. The project is undertaken under !(Dr. Gaurav Sharma)[https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/gaurav-sharma/] and will be integrated with a fluid solver for a fluid-structure interaction engine upon completion.
